            <h1>Daniel Burka</h1>
            
            <p class="intro">I am a product manager and designer who focuses on solving complex global health problems in simple ways.</p>
            
            <p>Today, I am the director of product and design at the not-for-profit <a href="http://resolvetosavelives.org">Resolve to Save Lives</a>, where I spend the majority my time on the open source <a href="http://simple.org">Simple</a> project. Simple is being used to help hundreds of hospitals to manage over 200,000 patients with hypertension.</p>
            
            <p>I am also on the board of <a href="https://www.laboratoria.la/en">Laboratoria</a>, a not-for-profit in that helps Latin American women from low-income backgrounds to build successful careers in tech. And, I'm a member of Adobe's <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/design-circle/">Design Circle</a> which grants scholarships to designers from around the world.</p>
            
            <hr>
            
            <p>I have a long and varied history in technology. When I was 16, I started a web design agency with my highschool friends and my twin brother, Nicholas. That company is now <a href="http://">silverorange</a>, which turned 20 years old in 2019. We learned the ropes and worked on notable projects like the <a href="https://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/branding-firefox">Firefox brand</a> and <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> website. I'm increasingly proud that silverorange is still going strong and changing the world for the better, one project at a time.</p>

            <p>In 2006 I was lured to Silicon Valley by <a href="http://kevinrose.com">Kevin Rose</a> to be the creative director at news pioneer, <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a>. For 5 years, we broke new ground in the way news was shared online. Kevin and I also co-founded the social network Pownce with Leah Culver, which we sold to Six Apart.</p>
            
            <p>I left at the zenith of Digg and Stewart Butterfield brought me on was an early member of the Tiny Speck team, designing the game Glitch. God bless Stewart and the team... I left after a year because I wasn't satisfied in the game world, and they went on to turn Glitch into the rocket ship <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Kevin Rose and I then started an incubator company called Milk, which we sold to <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> a year later. I spent the next 5 years as a design partner at <a href="http://gv.com">Google Ventures</a> where I go to work with a huge variety of companies like <a href="http://flatiron.com">Flatiron Health</a> and <a href="http://zipline.com">Zipline</a>.</p>
